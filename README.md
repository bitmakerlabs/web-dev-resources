### Be Social

Start attending meetups and become active on relevant chat channels. Everyone from novice to experts is welcome to join.

- **Rails Pub Nite:**
    A casual social mixer for people interested in Ruby on Rails, and those who love them. 7pm on third Monday of every month (except December).  Happens at The Rhino (1249 Queen St. West).

## If the course is over, but you're not feeling job ready...

- First, ask yourself if you're having a case of *Imposter Syndrome*. Imposter Syndrome is rife within our industry.  There's always more to know, and nobody knows everything. Be conscious that the psychological barrier can get in the way of learning and finding a new job. [Here's a great video about Imposter Syndrome](https://youtube.com/watch?v=eqhUHyVpAwE).

- Go over all the suggestions in the above sections and try to fill in any gaps you may be missing.

- Book Bitmaker alumni office hours for continued technical support.

- Find an open source project to get involved with. Look at libraries (e.g. gems and JavaScript libraries) that you've used before and that are under active development (i.e. have open issues and have many recent commits). If you're apprehensive about submitting code, try writing documentation, or even proof-reading documentation and submitting corrections:

    - Look through the issues tab of the project you're interested in. Sometimes issues will be labeled *'easy'*. Those are meant for people just starting out.
    - If you're interested in Rails, check out the [Contributing to Ruby on Rails Guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html).
    - Do a [google search for my first pull request](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=my+first+pull+request) to read stories from others about their experiences.

- Start your own project on something you care about. You can continue to come to the Bitmaker office to work on it.


## If you're looking for a job...

- On the first of every month, the Hacker News forum has a wildly popular "Who is Hiring?" post. To find the most recent post:

    1. Go to [HN Search](https://hn.algolia.com/)
    2. Enter the search terms `who is hiring <year> <month>`
    3. Once you're on the most recent *Who Is Hiring* page, do a find-in-page for *"Toronto"*, *"Canada"* and *"Remote"*. You'll find jobs you can do in or from Toronto.

    *For example, at the time of writing this document, I would search for `who is hiring 2017 march` and it would link to [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13764728).*

- Ensure your LinkedIn profile is up to date.

- [railstoronto.com](http://railstoronto.com/) has a good list of companies who use Ruby on Rails that you could approach.

- Along with searching for jobs in Toronto, look for remote opportunities. For example, [remote | OK](https://remoteok.io/) has many remote opportunities.

- Attend meetups. Often employers go to meetups to find new candidates. See our Meetups & Events section for a list of gatherings.

- Check out [Medium's Grading Rubric](https://medium.engineering/engineering-interviews-grading-rubric-8b409bec021f#.10vll2y87). You can get a detailed look at a tech company's hiring process and find out what companies might be looking for.

- Keep in touch with Bitmaker. We want to know how your search is going and we can offer further support. Often employers reach out to us and if we think you'd be a good candidate, we will refer you.

- Never stop learning and creating. See previous sections for our suggestions!
